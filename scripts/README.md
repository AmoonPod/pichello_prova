# Sanity Data Import Scripts

This directory contains scripts to import data into Sanity.

## CSV Product Import Script

The `import-products.ts` script reads product data from a CSV file and imports it into Sanity according to the defined schema.

### Features

- Properly sets up references between products and categories
- Handles brand information (marchi) according to schema
- Capitalizes names appropriately
- Creates slugs automatically
- Skips existing entries to avoid duplicates

### Requirements

- CSV file with product data in the correct format

### Setup

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:

   ```
   cd scripts
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Make sure your Sanity project is properly configured in the parent directory.

### Running the Import

### CSV Format

The script expects a CSV file with the following columns:

- Nome: Product name
- Descrizione: Product description
